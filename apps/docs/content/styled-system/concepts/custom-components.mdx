Sometimes, you may find yourself needing to build a component that doesn't exist in Hopper, but this component would benefit from using Hopper's style props.

There are 2 ways to build a custom component with Hopper style properties, as seen below:

### HTML Element

Instead of using a native HTML element to create your component, you can use one of the Hopper HTML Element components. This way, you can simply forward the style props to the component.

This is an example using a `Div`, but you can use any of the HTML Element components.

### useStyledSystem

If you need to build a more complex component, you can use the `useStyledSystem` function. This function allows you to create a custom component with Hopper style props.

The `useStyledSystem` function returns a `stylingProps` object containing a resulting style object and a className. You can then spread the `stylingProps` object on your component, or merge them with your existing className and style properties.

We don't automatically merge the `className` and `style` props because most of the className and style props in Hopper also accept a function.
