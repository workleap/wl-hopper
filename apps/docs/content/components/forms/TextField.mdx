Specialized text fields are available for different scenarios:

- If you want a text field with `type="search"`, use the [SearchField](./SearchField) component.
- If you want a text field that shows/hides a password, use the [PasswordField](./PasswordField) component.

<Example src="inputs/docs/text-field/preview" isOpen />

## Usage

### Disabled
A text field in a disabled state shows that an input field exists, but is not available in that circumstance. This can be used to maintain layout continuity and communicate that a field may become available later.

<Example src="inputs/docs/text-field/disabled" />

### ReadOnly
The `isReadOnly` prop makes the text field's text content immutable. Unlike `isDisabled`, the text field remains focusable and the contents can still be copied. See [the MDN docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Attributes/readonly) for more information.

<Example src="inputs/docs/text-field/readOnly" />

### Error
A text field can be displayed in an error state to indicate that the user input is invalid.

<Example src="inputs/docs/text-field/error" />

### Clearable
The `isClearable` prop can be set to `true` to display a clear button at the end of the input.

<Example src="inputs/docs/text-field/clearable" />

### Sizes
Text fields have multiple sizes to choose from.

<Example src="inputs/docs/text-field/sizes" />

### Labeling
If a visible label isn't specified, an `aria-label` must be provided to the text field for accessibility. If the field is labeled by a separate element, an `aria-labelledby` prop must be provided using the ID of the labeling element instead.

<Example src="inputs/docs/text-field/labeling" />

### Description
A text field with a helper message.

<Example src="inputs/docs/text-field/description" />

### Icon Prefix
An icon can be displayed at the start of the input.

<Example src="inputs/docs/text-field/iconPrefix" />

### Text Prefix
A short text can be displayed at the start of the input.

<Example src="inputs/docs/text-field/textPrefix" />

### Character Count
A character count can be displayed at the end of the input.
The character count is based on the `maxLength` prop.
If the `maxLength` prop is not set, the character count will not be displayed.

<Example src="inputs/docs/text-field/characterCount" />

### Max Length Exceeded
To exceed the max length, set the `allowExceedingMaxLength` prop to `true` – default is `false`. When the character count is displayed, it turns red if the max length is exceeded.

Note: If allowExceedingMaxLength is set, a character count is required to be set as well.

<Example src="inputs/docs/text-field/maxLengthExceeded" />

### ContextualHelp

A [ContextualHelp](/components/ContextualHelp) element may be placed next to the label to provide additional information or help about a TextField.

<Example src="inputs/docs/text-field/ContextualHelp" />

### Fluid
A text field can take the width of its container.

<Example src="inputs/docs/text-field/fluid" />
