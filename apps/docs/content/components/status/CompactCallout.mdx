## Anatomy

### Structure

```tsx
<CompactCallout>
    <Content /> /* (Required) The main content of the compact callout */
    <Button /> /* (Optional) A button for the compact callout */
    <Link /> /* (Optional) A link for the compact callout */
</CompactCallout>
```

### Composed Components

A `CompactCallout` uses the following components:

<ComposedComponents components={["Content", "Button", "Link"]} />

## Usage

### Variants
A compact callout can have the same variants.

<Example src="callout/docs/compactVariant" />

### Link
A compact callout can have either a button or a link as CTA. Here's an example where it's a link.

<Example src="callout/docs/compactLink" />

### Dismissable
Similar to the Callout, the dismiss icon appears only when `onClose` is set.

<Example src="callout/docs/dismissableCompact" />

## Best Practices

Callouts should:

- Be used thoughtfully and sparingly for only the most important information.
- Not be used to call attention to what a user needs to do in the interface instead of making the action clear in the UI itself.
- Not be the primary entry point to information or actions users need to take.
- Remove the icon only in scenarios where it takes up too much space, such as very small breakpoints.

### Placement

Callouts should be place in the appropriate context:

- Callouts relevant to an entire page should be placed at the top of that page, below the page header. They should occupy the full width of the content area.
- Callouts related to a section of a page should be placed inside that section, below any section heading. These callouts have less spacing and a pared-back design to fit within a content context.
- Banner related to an element more specific than a section should be placed immediately above or below that element.
