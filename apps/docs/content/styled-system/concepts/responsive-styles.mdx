## Introduction

In addition to static values, all style props support object syntax to specify different values for the prop depending on a responsive breakpoint. Breakpoints are named following t-shirt sizing, and correspond to common device resolutions.

### Example

A `Div` with a default background color overridden at each breakpoint. Resize your browser window to see this in action.

## Breakpoints

In addition to the base, there are five breakpoints inspired by typical device resolutions.

<BreakpointTable />

## Mobile-first

Hopper uses a mobile-first breakpoint system, similar to those in frameworks like Bootstrap and Tailwind.

<Callout variant="error">Don&apos;t use `sm:` to target mobile devices</Callout>

<Example src="HopperProvider/docs/responsive-styles/mobile-first-do-not" isOpen />

<Callout variant="success">Use `base` to target mobile devices</Callout>

<Example src="HopperProvider/docs/responsive-styles/mobile-first-do" isOpen />

Itâ€™s often best to start with the mobile first layout for a design, then add styles as the screen size increases, moving from small to larger screens.

## Utility Methods

### useResponsiveValue

To resolve a responsive value within a React component, Hopper provides a `useResponsiveValue` hook.
