## Usage

### Sizes
You can alter the size of the paragraph by specifying a `size` prop.
The available sizes match the Hopper Typography Type Scale â€” a type scale is a set of [font-size and line-height](https://hopper.workleap.design/tokens/semantic/typography#tokens-body) pairs.

### Inherit
You can also alter the size to match the parent element's type scale by using the `inherit` size.
