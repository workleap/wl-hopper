## Hopper Icon Overview

# Introduction

Icons are an essential part of building intuitive and engaging user interfaces. Hopper offers a versatile and comprehensive icon system tailored to meet diverse project needs, whether you're building with React or using static assets in other frameworks.

## [Using Hopper Icons](https://hopper.workleap.design/icons/overview/introduction\#using-hopper-icons)

Hopper provides two main packages, React components or pure SVG, giving you the flexibility to choose how to integrate icons into your project.

### [React Applications](https://hopper.workleap.design/icons/overview/introduction\#using-hopper-icons-react-applications)

Designed specifically for React applications, this package offers all icons as React components.

### [Other Frameworks](https://hopper.workleap.design/icons/overview/introduction\#using-hopper-icons-other-frameworks)

Ideal for non-React setups, this package provides raw SVG files.

## [Start Designing Icons](https://hopper.workleap.design/icons/overview/introduction\#start-designing-icons)

No matter the platform or design requirements, Hopper icons empower developers and designers to create polished, visually aligned interfaces.

- [Designing an Icon](https://hopper.workleap.design/icons/overview/designing-an-icon)

To maintain visual consistency across the Workleap platform, icon creators should follow these guidelines when contributing to the Workleap icon library.
**All designers are encouraged to create their own icons.** Use the design language and specifications outlined in this guide to ensure alignment across all Workleap products.

## [Before You Begin](https://hopper.workleap.design/icons/overview/designing-an-icon\#before-you-begin)

**1\. Review Existing Icons:**
Before proposing a new icon, explore the current icon set to determine if an existing design fits your needs. Avoid duplicating concepts and ensure your proposal adds unique value.

**2\. Understand the Design Language:**
The Workleap icon library follows a specific and consistent design language. Adhering to this language is crucial for maintaining a shared understanding across all verticals and ensuring new additions feel cohesive within Workleap's visual system.

## [Anatomy of an Icon](https://hopper.workleap.design/icons/overview/designing-an-icon\#anatomy-of-an-icon)

Icons in the Workleap library have several defined characteristics. Understanding these attributes is essential for creating high-quality contributions.

### [Definitions](https://hopper.workleap.design/icons/overview/designing-an-icon\#anatomy-of-an-icon-definitions)

- Frame Size - The dimensions of the artboard in which the icon is designed.
- Stroke Alignment - The stroke's position relative to the shape. Use **center** alignment unless the shape is closed; in that case, use **inside**.
- Corner Radius - Follow the standard radius values from the design specification table. Deviations are allowed only to improve legibility.
- Terminal - The end style of a stroke, which can be round, square, or flat.
- Inner spacing - The space between a shape and its stroke.
- Fill - The shape's color. Icons using a fill are also known as solid icons. Any shapes on a filled icon should follow the stroke guidelines.
- Keylines - Lines that define an icon's shape and stroke alignment. In Figma, toggle them using `âŒ˜G`(Mac) or `Ctrl+G`(PC).

### [Values](https://hopper.workleap.design/icons/overview/designing-an-icon\#anatomy-of-an-icon-values)

Use the following specifications when designing your icon:

| Anatomy | Small | Medium | Large |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Frame Size | 16X16 | 24X24 | 32X32 |
| Stroke Weight | 1.5px | 1.5px | 2px |
| Stroke Alignment | Center/Inside | Center/Inside | Center/Inside |
| Corner Radius | 1px | 1.5px | 2px |
| Terminal | Round | Round | Round |
| Inner Spacing | >= 1px | >= 2px | >= 2px |
