## Overview

Radio buttons are used for mutually exclusive choices, not for multiple choices. Only one radio button can be selection at a time. When a user chooses a new item, the previous choice is automatically deselected.
They can be used in tiles, data tables, modals, side panels, and in forms on full-page layouts.
Radio button can be used to change from one setting to another in a Listbox, page or component. It can often act as a filtering mechanism.

## Best practices

Radio buttons should:

- Always be used with an associated label component.
- Be part of a list of radio buttons that:
  - Include at least two or more choices.
  - Are used to have users select only one option.
  - Include mutually exclusive optionsâ€“this means that each option must be independant from every other option in the list.
  - List options in a logical order.
  - Have a default option selected whenever possible.

### Alignment

Radio button labels are positioned to the right of their inputs. As a grouping, they have to be laid out vertically.

### Placement

Radio buttons are often used in forms. In a forms, they should be placed at least 24px below or before the next component. A space of 8px between each radio button in a grouping is necessary.

### Overflow content

We recommend radio button labels being fewer than three words. If you are tight on space, consider rewording the label. Do not truncate the radio button label text with an ellipsis.
Long labels may wrap to a second line, and this is preferable to truncation. Text should wrap beneath the radio button so the control and label are top aligned.

### States

The radio button input allows for two states: unselected and selected. The default view of a radio button is having at least one radio button preselected. Only one radio should be selected at a time. When a user chooses a new item, the previous choice is automatically deselected.

### Grouping in a wrapper

When the Radio group is the only control in the container, or if you need to bring an intentional prominence to this control, we suggest to organize the Radio within a wrapper and to use the Medium size which will bring more scannability to the options.
