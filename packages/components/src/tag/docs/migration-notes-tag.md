Coming from Orbiter, you should be aware of the following changes:

- A dot is not supported
- `fluid` is not supported.
- `variant` values are now `neutral` | `subdued` | `progress` | `positive` | `caution` | `negative` | `option1` | `option2` | `option3` | `option4` | `option5` | `option6` and not `solid` | `outline`.
- `validationState` is not supported. Use `isInvalid` instead.
