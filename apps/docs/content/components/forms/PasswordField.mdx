## Usage

### Disabled
A password field in a disabled state shows that an input field exists, but is not available in that circumstance. This can be used to maintain layout continuity and communicate that a field may become available later.

<Example src="inputs/docs/password-field/disabled" />

### ReadOnly
The `isReadOnly` prop makes the PasswordField's text content immutable. Unlike `isDisabled`, the password field remains focusable and its content can still be copied. See [the MDN docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Attributes/readonly) for more information.

<Example src="inputs/docs/password-field/readOnly" />

### Error
A password field can be displayed in an error state to indicate that the user input is invalid.

<Example src="inputs/docs/password-field/error" />

### Sizes
Password fields can vary in size.

### Labeling
If a visible label isn't specified, an aria-label must be provided to the password field for accessibility. If the field is labeled by a separate element, an `aria-labelledby` prop must be provided using the ID of the labeling element instead.

<Example src="inputs/docs/password-field/labeling" />

### Description
A password field with a helper message.

<Example src="inputs/docs/password-field/description" />

### ContextualHelp

A [ContextualHelp](/components/ContextualHelp) element may be placed next to the label to provide additional information or help about a PasswordField.
