## Props

<PropTable component="LinkButton" />

## Anatomy

### Concepts

*LinkButton* makes use of the following concepts:

- [Client Side Routing](./client-side-routing)

### Structure

```tsx
<LinkButton>
    <IconList /> /* (Optional) A list of icons in the LinkButton */
    <Icon /> /* (Optional) An icon in the LinkButton */
    <Text /> /* (Optional) Text in the LinkButton, required if using an Icon or an IconList */
</LinkButton>
```

### Composed Components

A *LinkButton* uses the following components:

<ComposedComponents components={["Icon", "IconList", "Text"]}/>

## Usage

### Variants
A link button can use different variants.

<Example src="buttons/docs/link-button/variant" />

**Primary** - For the principal call to action on the page. Primary buttons should only appear once per screen — not including the application header, modal or side panel.

**Secondary** - For secondary actions on each page. Secondary buttons can be used in conjunction with a primary link button or on its own. Paired with a Primary link button, the secondary link button usually performs the negative action of the set, such as “Cancel.”

**Upsell** - For upsell actions that relate to upgrading an account or a plan. Use the upsell link button to distinguish it from an existing primary link button. In some cases, a primary link button can be used instead when the general context of the page is about upselling.

**Danger** - For actions that could have destructive effects on the user's data.

**Ghost-[primary|secondary|danger]** - For less prominent, and sometimes independent, actions. Ghost buttons can be used in isolation or paired with a primary link button when there are multiple calls to action. Ghost buttons can also be used for subtasks on a
page where a primary link button for the main and final action is present.

### Sizes
A link button can vary in size.

<Example src="buttons/docs/link-button/size" />

### Disabled
A link button can be disabled.

<Example src="buttons/docs/link-button/state" />

### External
Add isExternal attributes to render an external link button.

<Example src="buttons/docs/link-button/external" />

### No Href
When a link button link does not have an href prop, it is rendered as a `<span role="link">` instead of an `<a>`. Events will need to be handled in JavaScript with the `onPress` prop.

Note: this will not behave like a native link. Browser features like context menus and open in a new tab will not apply.

<Example src="buttons/docs/link-button/noHref" />

### Fluid
A link button can be expanded to full width to fill its parent container.

<Example src="buttons/docs/link-button/layout" />

### Icon Only
A link button can contain only an icon.

<Example src="buttons/docs/link-button/icon" />

### Router Link
A link button can be used with any Router. For more information, see the [Client Side Routing](./client-side-routing) article.

<Example src="buttons/docs/link-button/reactRouterLink" />

### Icon
A link button can contain icons.

<Example src="buttons/docs/link-button/icons" />

### End Icon
Nonstandard end icons can be provided to handle special cases. However, think twice before adding end icons, start icons should be your go-to.

<Example src="buttons/docs/link-button/endIcon" />
