Coming from Orbiter, you should be aware of the following changes:

- `disabled` has been renamed to `isDisabled`.
- `validationState` has been removed. `isInvalid` should be used instead.
- `tabbable` has been removed.
- `useVirtualFocus` doesn't exist.
- `Listbox` has been renamed to `ListBox` to follow [React Aria Components](https://react-spectrum.adobe.com/react-aria/ListBox.html).
