## Guidelines

- **Working with space** - Space is the distance between two objects in your design. It should be used to complement the purpose of a page by creating hierarchy and making the content clearer and more comprehensible.
- **Be harmonious** - Use space tokens in a way that is consistent with the rest of the experience. Some spaces are used in specific context, follow the proper documentation to apply space at the right places.
- **Create visual groups** - The more visual elements are related, the closer they should be to each other.

## Designing with space
Every part of a UI should be intentional including the empty space between elements. The amount of space between items creates relationships and hierarchy.

### Creating relationships
Elements in a design that are near each other are seen as being meaningfully related. As more space is added between elements, their perceived relationship weakens.

Patterns created through spacing can also create relationships. Elements arranged in the same spacing pattern are seen as related pieces that have equal weight.

Space can also be used to denote groups of associated information. This creates content sections on a page without having to use lines or other graphical elements as a divider.

### Creating hierarchy
Elements that have more spacing around them tend to be perceived as higher in importance than elements that have less space around them.
Take this page for instance. The top level headers have more space surrounding them giving them focus and prominence.
Then as the headers descend in importance they receive less space, signaling they are subordinate.

Elements that are set close to each other can be easily overlooked. Users may see the grouping but not process each individual item.
Therefore, if you have an element or content of high importance on the page, consider giving it extra surrounding space to help it attract focus.

### White space
Empty space — also known as white space — is important in design. It can be used to break up sections on a page or to help create focus on certain element(s).
White space helps with information processing; too much dense information can be disorienting or overwhelming for a user.
Sections of a UI are allowed to be dense, but the whole page should not be crowded; there should be white space to let the user’s eye rest.

## Tokens

### Padding

Padding refers to the space within a block or container from which elements are separated from the edge. Is is refered as inset in Hopper.

#### Inset

By default, the inset is equal on all four sides.

<TableSection tokenType={"semantic"} categoryKey="size" tokens={tokens.semantic.size} categories={
    ["inset"]
} excludedCategories={["inset-squish", "inset-stretch"]} />

#### Inset Squish

Squish inset reduces the top and bottom padding by one increment relative to the declared inset space.

<TableSection tokenType={"semantic"} categoryKey="size" tokens={tokens.semantic.size} categories={
    ["inset-squish"]
} />

#### Inset Stretch

Stretch inset increases the top and bottom padding by one increment relative to the declared inset space.

<TableSection tokenType={"semantic"} categoryKey="size" tokens={tokens.semantic.size} categories={
    ["inset-stretch"]
} />

### Margin

Margin refers to the traditional meaning of space between elements. It can be used as a margin or gap when in a grid or flex layout. It is refered as stack in Hopper. The last element of a stack should omit this space.

#### Stack

Stack is the space that separates elements or containers arranged vertically within a column.

<TableSection tokenType={"semantic"} categoryKey="size" tokens={tokens.semantic.size} categories={
    ["stack"]
} />

#### Inline

Inline refers to the space that separates inline elements arranged horizontally.

<TableSection tokenType={"semantic"} categoryKey="size" tokens={tokens.semantic.size} categories={
    ["inline"]
} />
