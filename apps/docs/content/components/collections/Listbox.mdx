## Overview

A listbox is a disclosure component that appear with a set of actions relevant to a specific control, interface area, data element or application view.
Typically, this context is determined by the user’s current selection prior to invoking the menu. Listbox can be opened from components such as Selects or Buttons.

## Best Practices

A listbox can be composed of:

- Options: the individual options inside the Listbox that users can select or deselect.
- Dividers: placed between items and are useful in complex lists when there’s a lot of information for the user to parse.
- Section headers: used at the beginning of a section when it’s necessary to call out the content being displayed. In most cases, the surrounding context should be enough for the user to understand the information in the list.
- Section footers: used to put important action that should be treated differently from the rest of the options or to put a small piece of information related to the options above.

Listboxes should:

- Be clearly labeled so it’s noticeable to the user what type of options will be available.
- Limit the number of options displayed at once.
- Indicate a loading state to the user while option data is being populated.

Use Listbox to hide less frequently used or advanced options until users specifically need them. This keeps the interface clean and focused on essential elements.

## Anatomy

### Composed Components

A `ListBox` uses the following components:

<ComposedComponents components={["Avatar", "Badge", "Header", "Icon", "Text"]}/>

## Usage

### Empty state

A list box can have an empty state.

<Example src="list-box/docs/empty" />

### Disabled

A list box with a disabled item.

<Example src="list-box/docs/disabled" />

### Invalid

A list box that is invalid.

<Example src="list-box/docs/invalid" />

### Fluid

A fluid list box will take up the full width of its container.

<Example src="list-box/docs/fluid" />

### Section

A list box can have sections and section headers.

<Example src="list-box/docs/section" />

### Dividers

A list box can have dividers.

<Example src="list-box/docs/divider" />

### Avatar

A ListBox can contain an avatar.

<Example src="list-box/docs/avatar" />

### Count

A list box can contain a count using a badge.

<Example src="list-box/docs/count" />

### Dynamic Lists

Items and sections can be populated from a hierarchial data structure.
If a section has a header, the `Collection` component can be used to render the child items.

<Example src="list-box/docs/dynamicLists" />

### Icons

A list box can contain icons.

<Example src="list-box/docs/icons" />

### End Icons

A list box can contain icons at the end of a list item.

<Example src="list-box/docs/endIcons" />

### Loading

A list box can have a loading state.

<Example src="list-box/docs/loading" />

### Load on scroll

A list box can load more items when scrolling within.

<Example src="list-box/docs/loadOnScroll" />

### Single selection

A list box can have a single selected item.

<Example src="list-box/docs/selection" />

### Single selection indicator

A list box can have a different selection indicator for single select.
By default, `disallowEmptySelection` is set to true when the selection indicator is a radio button.

<Example src="list-box/docs/selectionIndicator" />

### Multiple selection

A list box can have multiple selected items.

<Example src="list-box/docs/multipleSelected" />

### Sizes

List boxes can vary in size.

By default, the listbox maintains a minimum width of 218px to prevent a narrow appearance.
If the menu labels become longer, the listbox component can expand up to a maximum of 288px when triggered by a button, or to the total width of the Select field.

<Example src="list-box/docs/size" />

### Description

A list box item can have a description.

<Example src="list-box/docs/description" />

### Item size

List box items can vary in sizes.

<Example src="list-box/docs/multipleSizes" />
