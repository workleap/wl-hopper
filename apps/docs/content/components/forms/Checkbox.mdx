title: Checkbox
description: Checkboxes are used for multiple choices, not for mutually exclusive choices. Each checkbox works independently from other checkboxes in the list, therefore checking an additional box does not affect any other selections.

## Best Practices

Checkboxes should:

- Work independently from each other. Selecting one checkbox should not change the selection status of another checkbox in the list. The exception is when a checkbox is used to make a bulk selection of multiple items.
- Be framed positively.
- Always have a label when used to activate or deactivate a setting.
- Be listed according to a logical order, whether it's alphabetically, numerical, time-based, or some other clear system.
- Link to more information or include a helper text as required to provide more explanation. Don't rely on tooltips to explain a checkbox.

You can use checkboxes in many situations, such as:

- Forms: that can be in a full-page layout, in a modal or a panel.
- Filtering and batch action: to filter data either on a page, in a menu, or within a component. Checkboxes can be used in Tables for batch editing purposes.
- Tiles: to perform a selection over a collection of tiles that are related to one another.

### Alignment

Checkbox labels are positioned to the right of their inputs. If there is a checkbox grouping, they can be laid out vertically. When possible, arrange the checkbox and radio button groups vertically for easier reading.

### Placement

The checkbox component is often used in forms. Forms can be placed on a full page, in a modal or in a side panel. A checkbox can also be used for agreeing to terms and conditions or to filter information.
Checkboxes in a form should be placed at least 24px below of before the next component. There's a space of 8px between each checkbox within a grouping.

### Overflow content

We recommend checkbox labels being fewer than three words. If you are tight on space, consider rewording the label. Do not truncate checkbox label text with an ellipsis.
Long labels may wrap to a second line, and this is preferable than truncation. The text should wrap beneath the checkbox so the control and label are top aligned.

### Checkbox vs. Switch

Checkbox and Switch components are very similar in term of results when used in a form. However, a few details tell them apart.

- Checkbox component can offer multiple options to the user, while the Switch only offers one.
- Users can select none to any option with checkboxes, while the Switch always have one active selection at all time (either “on” or “off” position)
- Choices offered in checkbox grouping are independant from each other, while the Switch's mutually exclusive.
- The Switch's selection takes effect immediately, while the checkbox only happens once the user applied the change.

## Behaviours

### States

The checkbox input allows for a series of states: unselected, selected and indeterminate. The default view of a set of checkboxes is have no option selected.
Use the indeterminate state when the checkbox contains a sublist of selections, some of which are selected, and some unselected.

### Interactions

Users can trigger an item by clicking the checkbox input directly or by clicking the checkbox label. Having both regions interactive create a more accessible click target. The only hover effect when the mouse is placed over the target is a pointer shape change.

## Anatomy

### Composed Components

A `Checkbox` uses the following components:

<ComposedComponents components={["Icon", "IconList", "Text"]}/>

## Usage

### No Label

A checkbox can be rendered without a label.

<Example src="checkbox/docs/checkbox/nolabel"/>

### Checked

A checkbox can be checked.

<Example src="checkbox/docs/checkbox/checked"/>

### Indeterminate

A checkbox can be indeterminate.

<Example src="checkbox/docs/checkbox/indeterminate"/>

### Disabled

A checkbox can be disabled.

<Example src="checkbox/docs/checkbox/disabled" />

### Read-only

A checkbox can be read-only.

<Example src="checkbox/docs/checkbox/readonly" />

### Invalid

A checkbox can be invalid.

<Example src="checkbox/docs/checkbox/invalid"/>

### Sizes

A checkbox can vary in size.

<Example src="checkbox/docs/checkbox/size"/>

### Icon

A checkbox can be rendered with an icon or an icon list.

<Example src="checkbox/docs/checkbox/icons"/>

### Description

A checkbox can have a description to provide more information to the user.

<Example src="checkbox/docs/checkbox/description" />

## Props
