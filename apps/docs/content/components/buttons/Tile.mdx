## Anatomy

### Structure

```tsx
<Tile>
    <Text /> /* (Optional) Text is optional, but becomes required if any other elements are present */
</Tile>
```

### Composed Components

A `Tile` uses the following components:

<ComposedComponents components={["Text"] }/>

## Usage & Layout Samples

To facilitate the migration process, we've provided layout samples as reference guides. These examples demonstrate how to recreate features previously supported in [Orbiter](https://wl-orbiter-website.netlify.app/?path=/docs/tile--docs).

### Basic

A tile consists of minimally some content.

<Example src="tile/docs/migration/basic" />

### Image

A tile can have an image.

<Example src="tile/docs/migration/image" />

Or an illustration with a background color.

<Example src="tile/docs/migration/illustration" />

### Selected

A tile can be selected.

<Example src="tile/docs/migration/selected" />

### Disabled

A tile can be disabled.

<Example src="tile/docs/migration/disabled" />

### Orientation

A tile can render horizontally.

<Example src="tile/docs/migration/orientation" />

### Controlled

A tile can handle `isSelected` state in controlled mode.

<Example src="tile/docs/migration/controlled" />

## Best Practices

Tiles are always used in groups. Similarly to Radio, they should:

- Always have a clear label. You can use a description subtext to provide more details.
- Be part of a group of minimally two tiles.
- Be used to have users select one tile at once.
- Include mutually exclusive options.
- Be ordered in a logical way that users can understand.

Unlike Radio, it is not mandatory for Tiles to have a default option selected.
