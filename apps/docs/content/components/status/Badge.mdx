## Overview

A badge will communicate a small piece of information that users may be interested in, but would not impede them from achieving their task.
They can also display the amount of item for an object.

## Best Practices

Badges benefit users by:

- Being clearly labeled with short, scannable text
- Being positioned to clearly identify the object they're informing or labelling.

### Qualificative Badges

Badges can be used to qualify an object with a word or two. Most likely, badges will be used in specific situations, but are not limited to:

- New: to announce a new functionality or feature in Workleap. This badge should have a defined lifespan where at the end it is removed.
- Beta: to highlight that a functionality or feature is being released early to test and gather feedback. This badge should be accompanied by a Popover to provide more information to the user. This badge should have a defined lifespan where at the end it is removed.

### Quantitative Badges

Badges can also be used to count the number of item for an object. To ensure the best scannability quantitative badges should:

- Not be displayed if the count is at zero.
- Display “+99” if the count goes beyond 99 items.
- Use the same interaction state of the related object.

## Usage

### Disabled
A disabled badge is usually used inside other components that may be disabled, like a tag or a list box.

### Indeterminate
An indeterminate badge is used when the value is unknown or not applicable.

<Example src="badge/docs/badge/indeterminate" />

### Variants
The different variants of a badge.

### High Count
If a value above 99 is needed, use `99+` instead of the number.

### Text
A badge can have any text content.
