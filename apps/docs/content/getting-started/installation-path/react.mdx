Hopper is a Design System that provides a collection of [React components](../../components/component-list), [tokens](../../tokens/overview/introduction), and [icons](../../icons/overview/introduction) to help you build applications.

**Requirements:**
- [React 18](https://reactjs.org/) or higher.

## Installation

### Install Packages

Run the following command to install Hopper packages and their peer dependencies.

<PackageInstallation library="components @hopper-ui/icons @hopper-ui/styled-system react-aria react-aria-components" mod="prod" />

### Setup provider

Wrap your application with the [HopperProvider](/components/HopperProvider) component. This sets up the global styles and context required for Hopper components. Typically, this is done in your `index.tsx` or `app.tsx`, but it may vary depending on your setup.

```tsx {2,6,8}
import { HopperProvider } from "@hopper-ui/components";
import { createRoot } from 'react-dom/client';

const root = createRoot(document.getElementById('root'));
root.render(
    <HopperProvider theme="workleap" withBodyStyle>
        <App />
    </HopperProvider>
);
```

### Import Styles

Add Hopper styles to your project by importing the following CSS file. Place this in your global CSS file or main stylesheet.

```css
@import url("@hopper-ui/components/index.css");
```

### New: Import Theme

Add your product's theme to your project by importing the following CSS file. Place this in your global CSS file or main stylesheet.
You can add as many themes as you want, in case your application switch between different themes.
```css
@import url("@hopper-ui/styled-system/theme/workleap.css");
/** or */
@import url("@hopper-ui/styled-system/theme/sharegate.css");
```

Make sure to set the theme on your `HopperProvider` to match the imported theme.

### Enjoy!
Leverage Hopper's components and styled system to build user interfaces efficiently and with ease.

```tsx
import { Button, Stack } from "@hopper-ui/components";

const Demo = () => {
    return (
        <Stack>
            <Button>Click me</Button>
            <Button>Click me</Button>
        </Stack>
    );
}
```
