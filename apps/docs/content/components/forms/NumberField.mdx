## Usage

### Disabled
A number field in a disabled state shows that an input field exists, but is not available in that circumstance. This can be used to maintain layout continuity and communicate that a field may become available later.

<Example src="inputs/docs/number-field/disabled" />

### ReadOnly
The `isReadOnly` prop makes the number field's content immutable. Unlike `isDisabled`, the number field remains focusable and the contents can still be copied. See [the MDN docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Attributes/readonly) for more information.

<Example src="inputs/docs/number-field/readOnly" />

### Sizes
Number fields have multiple sizes to choose from.

<Example src="inputs/docs/number-field/sizes" />

### Labeling
If a visible label isn't specified, an `aria-label` must be provided to the number field for accessibility. If the field is labeled by a separate element, an `aria-labelledby` prop must be provided using the ID of the labeling element instead.

<Example src="inputs/docs/number-field/labeling" />

### Description
A number field with a helper message.

<Example src="inputs/docs/number-field/description" />

### Icon Prefix
An icon can be displayed at the start of the input.

<Example src="inputs/docs/number-field/iconPrefix" />

### Text Prefix
A short text can be displayed at the start of the input.

<Example src="inputs/docs/number-field/textPrefix" />

### Error
A number field can be displayed in an error state to indicate that the user input is invalid.

<Example src="inputs/docs/number-field/error" />

### Min Max
A number field can have a minimum and maximum value.

<Example src="inputs/docs/number-field/minmax" />

### Formatting
A number field can be formatted using this [format](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Intl/NumberFormat/NumberFormat).

<Example src="inputs/docs/number-field/formatting" />

### Fluid
A number field can take the width of its container.

<Example src="inputs/docs/number-field/fluid" />

### ContextualHelp

A [ContextualHelp](/components/ContextualHelp) element may be placed next to the label to provide additional information or help about a NumberField.

<Example src="inputs/docs/number-field/ContextualHelp" />

## Best Practices

- Be clearly labeled so it's obvious to users what they should enter into the field.
- Be labeled as “Optional” when you need to request input that's not required. View the Form pattern for more details on this.
- Only ask for information that's really needed.
- Validate input as soon as users have finished interacting with a field, but not before.
