The Hopper MCP Server is a specialized
[Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/introduction) server
that provides AI assistants (like GitHub Copilot, Claude Code, and Cursor) with access
to the Hopper Design System component library, design tokens, icons, and migration guidance.

## Setup

The Hopper MCP server is available at `https://hopper.workleap.design/mcp`.

### Visual Studio Code

To use the Hopper MCP server in Visual Studio Code, you need to configure the MCP server in your project.

> Make sure you have the
> [GitHub Copilot](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=GitHub.copilot)
> and
> [GitHub Copilot Chat](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=GitHub.copilot-chat)
> extensions installed.

In the `.vscode/mcp.json` file at the root of your project, add the MCP server configuration:

```json title=".vscode/mcp.json"
{
  "servers": {
    "hopper": {
      "url": "https://hopper.workleap.design/mcp",
      "type": "http"
    }
  }
}
```

The MCP server is now ready to use. Click on Start on the MCP server. Follow [this guide](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/chat/mcp-servers#_manage-mcp-servers) to learn how to run an MCP server.

To know how to use MCP tools in agent mode, refer to the [Use MCP tools in agent mode](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/chat/mcp-servers#_use-mcp-tools-in-agent-mode) section.

## Try It Now

You can use it for code generation, migration, or any questions you have about the Hopper Design System. A few examples:
- "What are Hopper design tokens and how should I use them?"
- "How do I create an accessible Hopper button component?"
- "How should I implement responsive design in the Hopper Design System?"
- "What are the best practices for using icons in Hopper?"
- "/generate_code_from_figma_design [figma_file_url]"

## Tools

The Hopper MCP server exposes the following tools to AI agents:

### Getting Started

- **`get_started`**: Essential first step that provides a guided workflow for using the Hopper Design System.

### Component Tools

- **`get_component_usage`**: Retrieve comprehensive component documentation including anatomy, structure, examples, dos and don'ts, and best practices
- **`get_component_props`**: Get detailed component API as JSON, including properties, attributes, methods, and events

### Guide Tools

- **`get_guide`**: Access comprehensive guides, best practices, and design tokens for the Hopper Design System.
  - For regular guides: `get_guide("styles")`, `get_guide("layout")`
  - For design tokens: `get_guide("tokens", category="semantic-color")` - category parameter is required

### Migration Tools

- **`migrate_from_orbiter_to_hopper`**: Helps agents migrate pages from Orbiter to Hopper using the [Design Systems Migrations Tools](https://github.com/workleap/wl-design-systems-migrations) and provided guides.

## Prompts
- **`generate_code_from_figma_design`**: Generate Hopper code from Figma designs (Required: [Figma MCP server](https://www.figma.com/mcp-catalog/)).
