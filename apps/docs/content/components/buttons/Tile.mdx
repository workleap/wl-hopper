## Props

<PropTable component="Tile" />

## Anatomy

### Structure

```tsx
<Tile>
    <Text /> /* (Optional) Text is optional, but becomes required if any other elements are present */
</Tile>
```

### Composed Components

A `Tile` uses the following components:

<ComposedComponents components={["Text"] }/>

## Usage

### Selected
A tile can be initially selected, by using `defaultSelectedKey` or `isSelected`.

<Example src="tile/docs/selected" />

### Disabled
A tile can be disabled.

<Example src="tile/docs/disabled" />

### Selected and Disabled

A tile can be selected and disabled.

<Example src="tile/docs/disabledSelected" />

## Best Practices

Tiles are always used in groups. Similarly to Radio, they should:

- Always have a clear label. You can use a description subtext to provide more details.
- Be part of a group of minimally two tiles.
- Be used to have users select one tile at once.
- Include mutually exclusive options.
- Be ordered in a logical way that users can understand.

Unlike Radio, it is not mandatory for Tiles to have a default option selected.
