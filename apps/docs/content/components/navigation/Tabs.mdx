## Overview

Tabs are used to group different but related content, allowing users to navigate views without leaving the page.
They always contain at least two items and one tab is active at a time.
Tabs can be used on full page layouts or in components such as modals, listbox, or side panels.

## Best practices

Tabs should:

- Represent the same kind of content, such as a list-view with different filters applied. Don’t use tabs to group content that is dissimilar.
- Only be active one at a time.
- Not force users to jump back and forth to do a single task. Users should be able to complete this work and find what they need under each tab.
- Not be used for primary navigation.

### Overflowing content

When the tab group’s width is larger than the space necessary to display all of the tabs, we group them within a menu. This grouping happens when two or more tabs cannot be visible in the viewport. We add tabs to the menu as the viewport gets narrower. The grouping is always at the end of the tab group.
However, the menu will never regroup all of the tabs of the tab group and will always keep the most important tab (the first one in the tab group) always visible.

When a user selects a tab from the tab grouping menu, the selected tab is displayed in the tab group and takes the position of the tab that was to the left of the grouping.

### Displaying tabs in grouping

When users click on the tab grouping button, we display the tabs in the same order they would have appeared without the grouping in a Listbox component. All details like count, icons and upsell are displayed in the listbox.

## Anatomy

A `Tab` uses the following components:

<ComposedComponents components={["Icon", "Badge", "Text", "Tag"] }/>

## Usage

### Sizes

Tabs can vary in size.

<Example src="tabs/docs/size" />

### Icon

A tab can contain an icon.

<Example src="tabs/docs/icon" />

### Lozenge

A tab can contain a lozenge.

<Example src="tabs/docs/lozenge" />

### Badge

A tab can contain a badge.

<Example src="tabs/docs/badge" />

### Dynamic Tabs

Tabs items can be rendered dynamically.

<Example src="tabs/docs/dynamic" />

### Manually Activated Tabs

By default, tabs are activated automatically. This means when you use the arrow keys to change tabs, the tab is activated and focused.

<Callout variant="information">
The content of a tab should ideally be preloaded. However, if switching to a tab panel causes a network request and possibly a page refresh, there might be some notable latency and this might affect the experience for keyboard and screen reader users.
</Callout>

In this scenario, you should use a manually activated tab, which moves focus without activating the tabs. With the focus on a specific tab, users can activate a tab by pressing Space or Enter.

### Variants

Tabs can use different variants.

<Example src="tabs/docs/variant" />

### Fluid

A tabs component can split the width of its container equally between its tabs.

<Example src="tabs/docs/fluid" />

### Controlled

The selectedKey state can be handled in a controlled mode.

<Example src="tabs/docs/controlled" />

### Disabled

All tabs can be disabled using the `isDisabled` prop.

<Example src="tabs/docs/disabled" />

#### Disabled items

An individual Tab can be disabled with the isDisabled prop. Disabled tabs are not focusable, selectable, or keyboard navigable.

<Example src="tabs/docs/disabledItems" />

In dynamic collections, it may be more convenient to use the disabledKeys prop at the Tabs level instead of isDisabled on individual tabs.
Each key in this list corresponds with the `id` prop passed to the Tab component, or automatically derived from the values passed to the items prop.
A tab is considered disabled if its id exists in `disabledKeys` or if it has `isDisabled`.

<Example src="tabs/docs/disabledKeys" />

### Embedded

Tabs can be embedded in other components.

<Example src="tabs/docs/embedded" />

### Links

Tabs can be used as links.

<Example src="tabs/docs/links" />
