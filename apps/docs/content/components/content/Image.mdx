<Example src="image/docs/image" isOpen />

## Usage

### Shapes

An image can use a different shape.

<Example src="image/docs/shape" />

### Sizes

An image can vary in size.

<Example src="image/docs/size" />

## Object fit

An image can have different object fits

<Example src="image/docs/objectFit" />

### Retina

You can let the browser decide which image is best to serve according to the user device screen pixel density.

It is highly recommended to serve a 1x image as well as a 2x image, twice the intended size. This assures the user has the best looking image possible.

Avoid serving images that are unecessary big, images should be resized to the intended final image display size. This assures we don't waste bandwith for the user.

<Example src="image/docs/retina" />

## SvgImage

For some use cases, like dark mode support, an SVG image is a better fit than a standard PNG or JPG image.

<Example src="image/docs/svg" />

### Size

An SVG image size can be specified with the `width` and `height` props.

<Example src="image/docs/svgSize" />

### Color

An SVG image `stroke` and `fill` color can vary.

<Example src="image/docs/svgColor" />

## Props

### Image

<PropTable component="Image" />

### SvgImage

<PropTable component="SvgImage" />
