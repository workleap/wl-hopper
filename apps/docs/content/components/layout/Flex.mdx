## Usage

### Vertical Alignment
A flex layout can have vertically aligned items.

<Example src="layout/docs/flex/verticalAlignment" />

### Gap
A flex layout can have a gap between his items. `columnGap` and `rowGap` are also available to specify a gap for a single axis.

<Example src="layout/docs/flex/gap" />

### Align Items
A flex layout can align its items along the cross-axis. When the direction is "column", this refers to horizontal alignment, and when the direction is "row", it refers to vertical alignment.

<Example src="layout/docs/flex/alignItems" />

### Justify Content
A flex layout can justify its items along the main axis. When the direction is "column", this refers to vertical alignment, and when the direction is "row", it refers to horizontal alignment.

<Example src="layout/docs/flex/justifyContent" />

### Reverse
A flex layout can show its items in reverse order.

<Example src="layout/docs/flex/reverse" />
