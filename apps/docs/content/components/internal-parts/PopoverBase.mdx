PopoverBase is a low-level building block that wraps React Aria's Popover to provide core popover functionality with Hopper's design system styling and enhancements.
It doesn't impose layout or padding, making it ideal for building custom popover structures from scratch.

## Usage

PopoverBase should be used with `PopoverTrigger` to handle the opening and closing of the popover:

<Example src="overlays/popover/docs/popover-base/preview" isOpen />

## Props

<PropTable component="PopoverBase" />
