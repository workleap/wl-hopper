Coming from Orbiter, you should be aware of the following changes:

- `outline` variant has been renamed `main`.
- `elevated` variant has been renamed `second-level`. You shouldn't use a `second-level` variant without a parent `main` variant.
- `orientation` has been removed. Refer to this [sample](#orientation) to see an implementation example.
- `fluid` prop has been removed. Refer to this [sample](#fluid) to see an implementation example.
- `size` has been removed. Refer to this [sample](#size) to quickly match old sizes.
- The Hopper Card component does not include predefined layouts; developers are responsible for implementing any required [layouts](#migration-notes-layout-samples) to meet their specific needs..
