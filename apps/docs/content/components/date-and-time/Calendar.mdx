## Usage

### Value

A Calendar has no selection by default. An initial, uncontrolled value can be provided to the Calendar using the defaultValue prop. Alternatively, a controlled value can be provided using the value prop.

Date values are provided using objects in the [@internationalized/date](https://react-spectrum.adobe.com/internationalized/date/index.html) package. This library handles correct international date manipulation across calendars, time zones, and other localization concerns.

Calendar supports values with both date and time components, but only allows users to modify the date. By default, Calendar will emit `CalendarDate` objects in the onChange event, but if a `CalendarDateTime` or `ZonedDateTime` object is passed as the value or defaultValue, values of that type will be emitted, changing only the date and preserving the time components.

### Controlled

A calendar can handle value state in controlled mode.

<Example src="calendar/docs/controlled" />

### Multi-month

Multiple CalendarGrid elements can be rendered to show multiple months at once.
The `visibleMonths` prop should be provided to the Calendar component to specify how many months are visible.

<Example src="calendar/docs/multi-month" />

#### Page Behaviour

The `pageBehavior` prop allows you to control how the calendar navigates between months.
By default, the calendar will navigate by `visibleMonths`, but by setting `pageBehavior` to `single`, pagination will be by one month.

<Example src="calendar/docs/page-behavior" />

### Validation

#### Min and Max

The `minValue` and `maxValue` props can be used to limit the range of dates that a user can select.

<Example src="calendar/docs/min-max" />

#### Unavailable Dates

Calendar supports marking certain dates as unavailable.
These dates remain focusable with the keyboard so that navigation is consistent, but cannot be selected by the user.
The isDateUnavailable prop accepts a callback that is called to evaluate whether each visible date is unavailable.

This example includes multiple unavailable date ranges, e.g. dates when no appointments are available.
In addition, all weekends are unavailable. The minValue prop is also used to prevent selecting dates before today.

<Example src="calendar/docs/unavailable" />

#### Error message

Calendar tries to avoid allowing the user to select invalid dates in the first place.
However, if according to application logic a selected date is invalid, the isInvalid prop can be set.
This alerts assistive technology users that the selection is invalid, and can be used for styling purposes as well.
In addition, the errorMessage slot may be used to help the user fix the issue.

This example validates that the selected date is a weekday and not a weekend according to the current locale.

### Disabled

A calendar can be disabled.

<Example src="calendar/docs/disabled" />

### Read-only

A calendar can be read-only.

<Example src="calendar/docs/readonly" />


### Custom First Day of the Week

By default, the first day of the week is automatically set based on the current locale.
This can be changed by setting the firstDayOfWeek prop to "sun", "mon", "tue", "wed", "thu", "fri", or "sat".
