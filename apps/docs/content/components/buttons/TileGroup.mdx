## Anatomy

### Structure

```tsx
<TileGroup>
    <Tile /> /* (Required) A tile in a TileGroup */
</TileGroup>
```

## Usage

### Selected
A tile group can have an item initially selected, by using `defaultSelectedKeys` for uncontrolled or `selectedKeys` for controlled.
Here's an example where one item is selected using defaultSelectedKeys.

<Example src="tile/docs/tile-group/selected" />

### Controlled
A tile group can have a controlled selected value. In this example, it shows how it is possible to select an option.

<Example src="tile/docs/tile-group/controlled" />

### Read-only
A tile group can be read-only.

<Example src="tile/docs/tile-group/readonly" />

### Disabled
A tile group can be disabled.

<Example src="tile/docs/tile-group/disabled" />

### Wrapping
Tiles are automatically wrapped

<Example src="tile/docs/tile-group/wrapping" />

### Number of columns
A tile group can have a number of columns. Default is 3. Here's an example where it's 4.

## Best Practices

Tiles are always used in groups. Similarly to Radio, they should:

- Always have a clear label. You can use a description subtext to provide more details.
- Be part of a group of minimally two tiles.
- Be used to have users select one tile at once.
- Include mutually exclusive options.
- Be ordered in a logical way that users can understand.

Unlike Radio, it is not mandatory for Tiles to have a default option selected.
