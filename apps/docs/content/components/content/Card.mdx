## Best Practices

Cards are used to group related information together. They follow a specific hierarchy to help users scan through content easily.
Whatever the level of hierarchy, Cards all share a 8px border radius.

Cards should:

- Display information that prioritizes what the user needs to know most first.
- Use headings that set clear expectations about the cardâ€™s purpose.
- Avoid too many CTA or links and only one primary CTA per card

## Usage

### Variants

A card can use different variants. Second-level cards need to be used within a first-level card.

<Example src="card/docs/variant" />

### Sections

A card can use a header, content, and footer section.

<Example src="card/docs/sections" />

## Props

<PropTable component="Card" />

    data={[
        { "Variant": "main",  "Purpose": "Main cards are used to set the first level of content of the page.  They use neutral-surface and border-weak tokens with no elevation. Most content is intended to be set in this card." },
        { "Variant": "second-level",  "Purpose":  "Second-level cards are used to group elements that are interactive within a main card with an overarching context, like a small form. They use a neutral-surface-weak token." },
    ]}
