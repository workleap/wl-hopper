## Overview

Links are used as navigational elements and can be used on their own or inline with text.
They provide a lightweight option for navigation but like other interactive elements, too many links will clutter a page and make it difficult for users to identify their next steps.
This is especially true for inline links, which should be used sparingly.

## Best practices

Links are used primarily for navigation, and usually appear within or directly following a sentence. Buttons are used primarily for actions.
Differentiating between the two both in the design and code result in:

- A more inclusive experience for assistive technology users.
- A more cohesive visual experience for sighted users.
- Products that are easier to maintain at scale.

### Open new tabs only when necessary

Use links whenever possible to avoid disorienting users and causing accessibility problems by opening a new tab. When using an external link, always use the NewTab icon beside the link’s label. External links should be used when users are:

- Performing a task or workflow.
- Navigating to a page outside of the Workleap platform.

Use links when you want users to:

- Navigate to a different page within the application
- Navigation to an entirely different site
- Jump to an element on the same page
- Link to emails or phone numbers

Use a button instead of a link for actions that will change data or manipulate how it is displayed, change a state, or trigger an action. Buttons should never be used for navigational actions.

## Anatomy

### Composed Components

A `Link` uses the following components:

<ComposedComponents components={["Icon", "Text"]}/>

## Usage

### Disabled

Links can be disabled.

<Example src="link/docs/disabled" />

### External

An external text link will render by default with `rel="noopener noreferrer"` and `target="_blank"` attributes.

<Example src="link/docs/external" />

### No Href

When a `<Link>` does not have an href prop, it is rendered as a `<span role="link">` instead of an `<a>`. Events will need to be handled in JavaScript with the `onPress` prop.

Note: this will not behave like a native link. Browser features like context menus and open in a new tab will not apply.

<Example src="link/docs/noHref" />

### Variants

Links can be presented in different variants.

<Example src="link/docs/variants" />

### Sizes

Links can be presented in different sizes.

<Example src="link/docs/size" />

### Inherit Size

The size can also be inherited.

<Example src="link/docs/inheritSize" />

### Icon

Links can contain an icon.

<Example src="link/docs/icon" />

### Start Icon

**Non standard** start icons can be provided to handle special cases. However, think twice before adding start icons, end icons should be your go to.

<Example src="link/docs/startIcon" />

### Icon Only

A link's content can be a single icon. When using this variant, an accessible name must be provided through the `aria-label` prop. See [WCAG practices](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20-TECHS/ARIA6.html).

<Example src="link/docs/iconOnly" />

### Quiet

All links can have a quiet style, without an underline. This style should only be used when the placement and context of the link is explicit enough that a visible underline isn’t necessary.

<Example src="link/docs/quiet" />

### Standalone

All links can have a standalone style, without an underline which is similar to quiet, the difference is this adds block padding to make it more similar to a button.

<Example src="link/docs/standalone" />

### React Router Link

A button can be rendered as a react router link when using the `href` property and setting the navigate property on the `HopperProvider`

<Example src="link/docs/reactRouterLink" />

### Custom Styles

When the colors from the variant props are not enough, you can use the `color` prop to set the color of the link. This removes the hover and focus colors from the link. Use the color props when a link needs to be placed on top of a colored background or visual. Make sure that the background and the link color meet the minimum color contrast ratio.

<Example src="link/docs/staticColor" />

### Image

A link's content can be an image element.

<Example src="link/docs/image" />
