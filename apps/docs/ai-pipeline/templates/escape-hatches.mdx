# Escape Hatches - Available UNSAFE_* Props

**IMPORTANT: This is a COMPLETE list of all available UNSAFE_* props.**

- If a prop is NOT listed here, use it normally WITHOUT the `UNSAFE_` prefix

Examples:

- ❌ `UNSAFE_overflow="hidden"` - ERROR: this doesn't exist, use `overflow="hidden"` normally
- ❌ `UNSAFE_style={...}` - ERROR: this doesn't exist, use `style={...}` normally
- ❌ `UNSAFE_top="5x"` - ERROR: this doesn't exist, use `top="5px"` normally
- ❌ `UNSAFE_flex="1"` - ERROR: this doesn't exist, use `flex="1"` normally
- ✅ `UNSAFE_width="100px"` - width is in the following list, so `UNSAFE_` version exists
