## Overview

The disclosure component delivers large amounts of content in a small space through progressive disclosure.
The header section give the user a high level overview of the content allowing the user to decide which sections to read.
Disclosures can make information processing and discovering more effective.
However, it does hide content from users and it’s important to account for a user not noticing or reading all of the included content.
If a user is likely to read all of the content then don’t use a disclosure as it adds the burden of an extra click; use instead a full scrolling page with normal headers.
Users can open or close a with different interactive element such as a button or the AngleUp and AngleDown icons.

## Best Practices

The disclosure component should:

- Be used for information that is lower priority or that users don’t need to see all the time.
- Not be used to hide error messages or other critical information that requires an immediate action.

## Anatomy

### Composed Components

A `Disclosure` uses the following components:

<ComposedComponents components={["Text", "Icon"]}/>

## Usage

### Disabled

A disclosure can be disabled.

<Example src="disclosure/docs/disabled" />

### Variants

A disclosure has multiple variants.

<Example src="disclosure/docs/variants" />

**Standalone** - Used when the disclosure is not inside a container.

**Inline** - Used when placing a disclosure inside a container.

### Icon

A disclosure can contain an icon.

<Example src="disclosure/docs/icon" />

### Description

A disclosure can contain a description.

<Example src="disclosure/docs/description" />

### Controlled

A disclosure can handle its expanded state in controlled mode.

<Example src="disclosure/docs/controlled" />

### Custom Header

A disclosure can have a custom header. To accomplish this, do not use `DisclosureHeader` and use the [Button](./Button) component with `slot="trigger"` instead.
Using React Aria's [Button](https://react-spectrum.adobe.com/react-aria/Button.html) component will also work.

<Example src="disclosure/docs/customHeader" />

## Props

### Disclosure
<PropTable component="Disclosure" />

### Disclosure Header
<PropTable component="DisclosureHeader" />

### Disclosure Panel
<PropTable component="DisclosurePanel" />

## Progressive Enhancement

Our Disclosure component uses experimental CSS features like:

- **interpolate-size: allow-keywords**: Enables fluid transitions between dynamic sizes.

- **transition-behavior: allow-discrete**: Allows transitions for properties like content-visibility.

These features enhance animations where supported. In browsers without support, the component remains fully usable without animations, maintaining progressive enhancement.
