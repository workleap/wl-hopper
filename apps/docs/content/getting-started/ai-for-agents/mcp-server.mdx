The Hopper MCP Server is a specialized
[Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/introduction) server
that provides AI assistants (like GitHub Copilot, Claude Code, and Cursor) with access
to the Hopper Design System component library, design tokens, icons, and migration guidance.

## Setup

The Hopper MCP server is available at `https://hopper.workleap.design/mcp`.

### Visual Studio Code

To use the Hopper MCP server in Visual Studio Code, you need to configure the MCP server in your project.

> Make sure you have the
> [GitHub Copilot](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=GitHub.copilot)
> and
> [GitHub Copilot Chat](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=GitHub.copilot-chat)
> extensions installed.

In the `.vscode/mcp.json` file at the root of your project, add the MCP server configuration:

```json title=".vscode/mcp.json"
{
  "servers": {
    "hopper": {
      "url": "https://hopper.workleap.design/mcp",
      "type": "http"
    }
  }
}
```

The MCP server is now ready to use. Click on Start on the MCP server. Follow [this guide](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/chat/mcp-servers#_manage-mcp-servers) to learn how to run an MCP server.

To know how to use MCP tools in agent mode, refer to the [Use MCP tools in agent mode](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/chat/mcp-servers#_use-mcp-tools-in-agent-mode) section.

## Try It Now

You can use it for code generation, migration, or any questions you have about the Hopper Design System. A few examples:
- "/generate_code_from_figma_design [figma_file_url]"

- "What are Hopper design tokens and how should I use them?"
- "What are available spacing tokens for 8px in Hopper?"
- "How do I create an accessible Hopper button component?"
- "How should I implement responsive design in the Hopper Design System?"
- "What are the best practices for using icons in Hopper?"

- "Use Hopper tooling to analyze Hopper usage in this folder"
- "Use Hopper MCP migration tool to migrate only layout components imported from the Orbiter within the src folder"
- "How could I use Hopper CLI tool to analyze Hopper usage in this folder?"

## Tools

The Hopper MCP server exposes the following tools to AI agents:

### Component Tools

- **`get_component_doc`**: Retrieve comprehensive component documentation including anatomy, structure, examples, dos and don'ts, and best practices. Also supports retrieving detailed component API as JSON, including properties, attributes, methods, and events.

### Guide Tools

- **`get_guide`**: Access comprehensive guides, best practices, and design tokens for the Hopper Design System.
  - For regular guides: `get_guide("styles")`, `get_guide("layout")`, etc.
  - For design tokens: `get_guide("tokens", category="semantic-color")`

### Search Tools
- **`get_design_tokens`**: Search for design tokens by category, name, CSS value, or supported Props.
- **`get_icons`**: Search for icons by name, type, keyboard, or description.

### Migration Tools

- **`migrate_from_orbiter_to_hopper`**: Helps agents migrate pages from Orbiter to Hopper using the [Design Systems Migrations Tools](https://github.com/workleap/wl-design-systems-migrations) and provided guides.

## Prompts

- **`build_hopper_app`**: Provides essential workflow and best practices for building applications with the Hopper Design System. Includes guidance on design tokens, component usage, styling, layout, and validation.
- **`generate_code_from_figma_design`**: Generate Hopper code from Figma designs (Required: [Figma MCP server](https://www.figma.com/mcp-catalog/)).

## Resources

The Hopper MCP server exposes documentation through structured resource URIs:

- **`hopper://llms-full`**: Complete documentation with all components, APIs, tokens, styles, and icons
- **`hopper://components/{name}/usage`**: Component usage documentation and best practices
- **`hopper://components/{name}/props`**: Component API (brief or full)
- **`hopper://tokens/{category}`**: Design tokens by category (e.g., `semantic-color`, `core-dimensions`)
- **`hopper://guides/{section}`**: Guides for installation, styles, layout, forms, etc.
- **`hopper://icons/{type}`**: Icon collections (`react` or `svg`)
- **`hopper://component-list`**: List of all available components
