The PopoverBase component is an internal building block that provides the core popover functionality with Hopper's styling.
It's a wrapper around React Aria's Popover component that adds Hopper's design system styling and additional features.

## When to use

PopoverBase is primarily intended as an internal component for building higher-level components.
You should use it when you're building a custom overlay component that requires popover functionality.

## Basic usage

PopoverBase should be used with `PopoverTrigger` to handle the opening and closing of the popover:

<Example src="overlays/popover/docs/popover-base/preview" isOpen />

## Props

<PropTable component="PopoverBase" />
