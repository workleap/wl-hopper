## Usage

### Vertical Alignment
A flex layout can have vertically aligned items.

<Example src="layout/docs/flex/verticalAlignment" />

### Gap
A flex layout can have a gap between his items. `columnGap` and `rowGap` are also available to specify a gap for a single axis.

<Example src="layout/docs/flex/gap" />

### Align Items
A flex layout can align its items along the cross-axis. When the direction is "column", this refers to horizontal alignment, and when the direction is "row", it refers to vertical alignment.

<Example src="layout/docs/flex/alignItems" />

### Justify Content
A flex layout can justify its items along the main axis. When the direction is "column", this refers to vertical alignment, and when the direction is "row", it refers to horizontal alignment.

<Example src="layout/docs/flex/justifyContent" />

### Reverse
A flex layout can show its items in reverse order.

<Example src="layout/docs/flex/reverse" />

### Wrap
Flex layout items can wrap multiple rows.

<Example src="layout/docs/flex/wrap" />

### Nesting
Flex layouts can be nested.

## Best Practices

Flex should be used for general-purpose flexible layouts when you need more control than `Inline` or `Stack` provide. For simple horizontal rows with centered items, use `Inline`. For simple vertical stacks, use `Stack`. Use `Flex` when you need to customize multiple layout properties, use responsive direction changes, or apply flex properties to individual children.

Flex should:

- Be used when you need to customize two or more layout properties (e.g., both `alignItems` and `justifyContent`).
- Handle responsive layouts where `direction` changes based on breakpoints.
- Be preferred over `Inline` or `Stack` when children need individual flex properties like `flex`, `order`, or custom alignment.
- Use [Hopper space tokens](/tokens/semantic/space) for `gap`, `rowGap`, and `columnGap` to ensure consistency.

### Do's and Don'ts

<DosAndDonts
    items={[
        {
            do: {
                explanation: "Use Inline for simple horizontal layouts with centered items",
                example: <CodeOnlyExample src="layout/docs/flex/dos-and-donts/inline-do" />
            },
            dont: {
                explanation: "Use Flex with default direction='row' and alignItems='center' when Inline is sufficient",
                example: <CodeOnlyExample src="layout/docs/flex/dos-and-donts/inline-dont" />
            }
        },
        {
            do: {
                explanation: "Use Stack for simple vertical layouts with consistent spacing",
                example: <CodeOnlyExample src="layout/docs/flex/dos-and-donts/stack-do" />
            },
            dont: {
                explanation: "Use Flex with direction='column' when Stack is sufficient",
                example: <CodeOnlyExample src="layout/docs/flex/dos-and-donts/stack-dont" />
            }
        },
    ]}
