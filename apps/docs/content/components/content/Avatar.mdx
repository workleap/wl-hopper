## Usage

### Local Image

An avatar can display a local image.

<Example src="avatar/docs/localImage" />

### Remote image

An avatar can fetch a remote image.

<Example src="avatar/docs/remoteImage" />

### Fallback image

A fallback image can be set in case the `src` fails to load.

<Example src="avatar/docs/fallbackImage" />

### Loading Failure

When an image fails to load, a default image will be displayed.

<Example src="avatar/docs/brokenImage" />

### Double Failure

When the fallback image fails to load, a default image will be displayed.

<Example src="avatar/docs/brokenImageWithBothFailing" />

### Src and Fallback Bypass

If no fallback image is provided and the image fails to load, the initials will be displayed instead.

<Example src="avatar/docs/brokenImageWithNoFallback" />

### Anonymous

An anonymous avatar can be displayed.

<Example src="avatar/docs/anonymous" />

### Deleted

A deleted avatar can be displayed.

<Example src="avatar/docs/deleted" />

### Broken

A broken avatar can be displayed.

<Example src="avatar/docs/broken" />

### Sizes

An avatar can be displayed in different sizes.

- Extra small (16px): use in tightly condensed layouts. This size can only accommodate one letter when using the Initials variant.
- Small (24px): use when the medium size is too big for the layout, or when the avatar has less importance in the context.
- Medium (32px): use as the default size
- Large (48px): use when an avatar is a focal point, such on a member page header
- Extra large (64px): use when an avatar is a focal point, such on a member page header

<Example src="avatar/docs/sizes" />

### Disabled

An avatar can be disabled.

<Example src="avatar/docs/disabled" />

### Pressable
An avatar can be pressed, which will trigger an action when pressed.

<Example src="avatar/docs/press" />

### Customize the image props

Using a custom hook to retry loading the image up to 5 times with a 250ms delay.

<Example src="avatar/docs/customization" />

### AvatarGroup

An avatar group can be used to display multiple avatars.

<Example src="avatar/docs/avatar-group/preview" />

#### Too many avatars

When there are too many avatars, a counter will be displayed.

<Example src="avatar/docs/avatar-group/tooMany" />

#### Sizes

An avatar group can be displayed in different sizes.

<Example src="avatar/docs/avatar-group/sizes" />

#### Pressable avatars
An avatar group can have pressable avatars, which will trigger an action when pressed.

<Example src="avatar/docs/avatar-group/pressable" />

#### Max number of avatars

An avatar group can be limited to a maximum number of avatars.

<Example src="avatar/docs/avatar-group/maxNumberOfAvatars" />

## Best Practices

Any time you use an image to communicate a concept in Workleap, it's important to use descriptive alt text.
Doing this is important for accessibility because it allows screen readers to describe what's in the image to people who may not be able to see it.
