## Introduction

Hopper supports a multiple themes for different product lines. Themes allow applications to customize the appearance of all Hopper components to match a specific brand.

## Applying a theme

A theme needs to be provided to a [HopperProvider](./HopperProvider).

Theme can also be nested. This might be useful for certain experiences, such as theme previews, where you want to showcase a specific theme.

## Context Hooks

To manage the theme in your application, Hopper exposes a `ThemeContext` and a `useThemeContext` hook.
Make sure that your application includes all the css files required for the themes you want to support.
