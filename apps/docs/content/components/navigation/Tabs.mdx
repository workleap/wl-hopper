## Anatomy

A `Tab` uses the following components:

<ComposedComponents components={["Icon", "Badge", "Text", "Tag"] }/>

## Usage

### Sizes

Tabs can vary in size.

<Example src="Tabs/docs/size" />

### Icon

A tab can contain an icon.

<Example src="Tabs/docs/icon" />

### Lozenge

A tab can contain a lozenge.

<Example src="Tabs/docs/lozenge" />

### Badge

A tab can contain a badge.

<Example src="Tabs/docs/badge" />

### Dynamic Tabs

Tabs items can be rendered dynamically.

<Example src="Tabs/docs/dynamic" />

### Manually Activated Tabs

By default, tabs are activated automatically. This means when you use the arrow keys to change tabs, the tab is activated and focused.

```
The content of a tab should ideally be preloaded. However, if switching to a tab panel causes a network request and possibly a page refresh, there might be some notable latency and this might affect the experience for keyboard and screen reader users.
```

In this scenario, you should use a manually activated tab, which moves focus without activating the tabs. With the focus on a specific tab, users can activate a tab by pressing Space or Enter.

### In card

A tabs component can be rendered as an in-card variant.

<Example src="Tabs/docs/in-card" />

### Heading

A tabs component can be rendered as a heading variant.

<Example src="Tabs/docs/heading" />

### Fluid

A tabs component can split the width of its container equally between its tabs.

### Controlled

The selectedKey state can be handled in a controlled mode.
