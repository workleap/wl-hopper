## Usage

### Value

A RangeCalendar has no selection by default. An initial, uncontrolled value can be provided to the RangeCalendar using the `defaultValue` prop. Alternatively, a controlled value can be provided using the `value` prop.

Date values are provided using objects in the [@internationalized/date](https://react-spectrum.adobe.com/internationalized/date/index.html) package. This library handles correct international date manipulation across calendars, time zones, and other localization concerns.

RangeCalendar supports values with both date and time components, but only allows users to modify the date. By default, RangeCalendar will emit `CalendarDate` objects in the onChange event, but if a `CalendarDateTime` or `ZonedDateTime` object is passed as the value or defaultValue, values of that type will be emitted, changing only the date and preserving the time components.

<Example src="calendar/docs/range-calendar/value" />

### Controlled

A range calendar can handle value state in controlled mode.

<Example src="calendar/docs/range-calendar/controlled" />

### Multi-month

Multiple CalendarGrid elements can be rendered to show multiple months at once.
The `visibleMonths` prop should be provided to the Calendar component to specify how many months are visible.

<Example src="calendar/docs/range-calendar/multi-month" />

#### Page Behavior

The `pageBehavior` prop allows you to control how the calendar navigates between months.
By default, the calendar will navigate by `visibleMonths`, but by setting `pageBehavior` to `single`, pagination will be by one month.

<Example src="calendar/docs/range-calendar/page-behavior" />

#### Fixed weeks

The `isFixedWeeks` prop allows you to control whether the calendar displays fixed weeks.
By default, the calendar will display variable weeks, but by setting `isFixedWeeks` to true, all months will be displayed with 6 weeks.
This ensures that the height of the calendar does not change when navigating between months.

<Example src="calendar/docs/range-calendar/fixed-weeks" />

### Validation

#### Min and Max

The `minValue` and `maxValue` props can be used to limit the range of dates that a user can select.

<Example src="calendar/docs/range-calendar/min-max" />

#### Unavailable Dates

RangeCalendar supports marking certain dates as unavailable. These dates remain focusable with the keyboard so that navigation is consistent, but cannot be selected by the user. In this example, they are displayed in red. The `isDateUnavailable` prop accepts a callback that is called to evaluate whether each visible date is unavailable.

Note that by default, users may not select non-contiguous ranges, i.e. ranges that contain unavailable dates within them. Once a start date is selected, enabled dates will be restricted to subsequent dates until an unavailable date is hit. See [below](#non-contiguous-ranges) for an example of how to allow non-contiguous ranges.

This example includes multiple unavailable date ranges, e.g. dates when a rental house is not available. The `minValue` prop is also used to prevent selecting dates before today.

<Example src="calendar/docs/range-calendar/unavailable" />

#### Non-contiguous ranges

The `allowsNonContiguousRanges` prop enables a range to be selected even if there are unavailable dates in the middle. The value emitted in the onChange event will still be a single range with a start and end property, but unavailable dates will not be displayed as selected. It is up to applications to split the full selected range into multiple as needed for business logic.

This example prevents selecting weekends, but allows selecting ranges that span multiple weeks.

<Example src="calendar/docs/range-calendar/non-contiguous-ranges" />

#### Error message

RangeCalendar tries to avoid allowing the user to select invalid dates in the first place. However, if according to application logic a selected date range is invalid, the `isInvalid` prop can be set.
This alerts assistive technology users that the selection is invalid, and can be used for styling purposes as well. In addition, the `errorMessage` slot may be used to help the user fix the issue.

This example validates that the selected date range is a maximum of 1 week in duration.

<Example src="calendar/docs/range-calendar/error-message" />

### Disabled

A range calendar can be disabled.

<Example src="calendar/docs/range-calendar/disabled" />

### Read-only

A range calendar can be read-only.

<Example src="calendar/docs/range-calendar/readonly" />

### Custom First Day of the Week

By default, the first day of the week is automatically set based on the current locale.
This can be changed by setting the `firstDayOfWeek` prop to "sun", "mon", "tue", "wed", "thu", "fri", or "sat".

<Example src="calendar/docs/range-calendar/custom-first-day" />
