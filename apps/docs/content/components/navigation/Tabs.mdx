## Anatomy

A `Tab` uses the following components:

<ComposedComponents components={["Icon", "Badge", "Text", "Tag"] }/>

## Usage

### Sizes

Tabs can vary in size.

<Example src="tabs/docs/size" />

### Icon

A tab can contain an icon.

<Example src="tabs/docs/icon" />

### Lozenge

A tab can contain a lozenge.

<Example src="tabs/docs/lozenge" />

### Badge

A tab can contain a badge.

<Example src="tabs/docs/badge" />

### Dynamic Tabs

Tabs items can be rendered dynamically.

<Example src="tabs/docs/dynamic" />

### Manually Activated Tabs

By default, tabs are activated automatically. This means when you use the arrow keys to change tabs, the tab is activated and focused.

<Callout variant="information">
The content of a tab should ideally be preloaded. However, if switching to a tab panel causes a network request and possibly a page refresh, there might be some notable latency and this might affect the experience for keyboard and screen reader users.
</Callout>

In this scenario, you should use a manually activated tab, which moves focus without activating the tabs. With the focus on a specific tab, users can activate a tab by pressing Space or Enter.

### Variants

Tabs can use different variants.

<Example src="tabs/docs/variant" />

### Fluid

A tabs component can split the width of its container equally between its tabs.

<Example src="tabs/docs/fluid" />

### Controlled

The selectedKey state can be handled in a controlled mode.

<Example src="tabs/docs/controlled" />

### Disabled

All tabs can be disabled using the `isDisabled` prop.

<Example src="tabs/docs/disabled" />

#### Disabled items

An individual Tab can be disabled with the isDisabled prop. Disabled tabs are not focusable, selectable, or keyboard navigable.

<Example src="tabs/docs/disabledItems" />

In dynamic collections, it may be more convenient to use the disabledKeys prop at the Tabs level instead of isDisabled on individual tabs.
Each key in this list corresponds with the `id` prop passed to the Tab component, or automatically derived from the values passed to the items prop.
A tab is considered disabled if its id exists in `disabledKeys` or if it has `isDisabled`.

<Example src="tabs/docs/disabledKeys" />

### Embedded

Tabs can be embedded in other components.

<Example src="tabs/docs/embedded" />

### Links

Tabs can be used as links.

<Example src="tabs/docs/links" />

<PropTable component="Tabs" />

### TabList

<PropTable component="TabList" />
