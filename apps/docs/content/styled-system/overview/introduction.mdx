Hopper embraces a **Styled System-inspired** approach to styling components, allowing developers to define styles directly via props rather than writing CSS. This method provides a **type-safe and intuitive API**, making it easier to build consistent, on-brand interfaces without dealing with complex class names or global styles. With built-in **intellisense and static analysis**, developers can confidently apply design tokens without memorizing them, ensuring efficiency and reducing errors.
