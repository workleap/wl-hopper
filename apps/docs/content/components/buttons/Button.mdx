## Anatomy

### Structure

```tsx
<Button>
    <Icon />
    <Text /> {/* MANDATORY IF USING ICON */}
</Button>
```
### Composed Components

A `Button` uses the following components:

<ComposedComponents components={["Icon", "IconList", "Text"] }/>

### üü¢ Dos and ‚ùå Don'ts
<DoDont>
    <DoDont.Item>
        <Do>When you have icon button, it is **mandatory** to wrap the text with `<Text>`. e.g. `<Button><Text>Save</Text><Icon/></Button>`</Do>
        <Dont>Use text without `<Text>` if you have icons. e.g. `<Button><Icon/Save></Button>`</Dont>
    </DoDont.Item>
</DoDont>

## Usage

### Variants
A button can use different variants.

<Example src="buttons/docs/button/variant" />

**Primary** - For the principal call to action on the page. Primary buttons should only appear once per screen ‚Äî not including the application header, modal or side panel.

**Secondary** - For secondary actions on each page. Secondary buttons can be used in conjunction with a primary button or on its own. Paired with a Primary button, the secondary button usually performs the negative action of the set, such as ‚ÄúCancel.‚Äù

**Upsell** - For upsell actions that relate to upgrading an account or a plan. Use the upsell button to distinguish it from an existing primary button. In some cases, a primary button can be used instead when the general context of the page is about upselling.

**Danger** - For actions that could have destructive effects on the user‚Äôs data.

**Ghost-[primary|secondary|danger]** - For less prominent, and sometimes independent, actions. Ghost buttons can be used in isolation or paired with a primary button when there are multiple calls to action. Ghost buttons can also be used for subtasks on a
page where a primary button for the main and final action is present.

### Sizes
A button can vary in size.

<Example src="buttons/docs/button/size" />

### Disabled
A button can be disabled.

<Example src="buttons/docs/button/state" />

### Loading
A button can show a loading indicator. The button text is hidden but the button maintains the width that it would have if the text were visible.

<Example src="buttons/docs/button/loading" />

### Pending
Buttons can indicate that a quick progress task is taking place (e.g., saving settings on a server). After a 1 second delay, an indeterminate spinner will be displayed in place of the button label and icon.

<Example src="buttons/docs/button/pending" />

### Fluid
A button can be expanded to full width to fill its parent container.

<Example src="buttons/docs/button/layout" />

### Icon Only
A button can contain only an icon. An accessible name must be provided through [aria-label](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Attributes/aria-label) prop. See also [WCAG practices](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20-TECHS/ARIA6.html).

<Example src="buttons/docs/button/icon" />

### Icon
A button can contain icons.

<Example src="buttons/docs/button/icons" />

### End Icon
Nonstandard end icons can be provided to handle special cases. However, think twice before adding end icons, start icons should be your go-to.

<Example src="buttons/docs/button/endIcon" />
