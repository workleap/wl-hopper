## Introduction

Hopper includes layout components to help build applications. The [Flex](./Flex) and [Grid](./Grid)
components are containers responsible for the layout of their children. `Flex` follows the the
[CSS flexbox](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Flexible_Box_Layout/Basic_Concepts_of_Flexbox)
algorithm, while `Grid` implements
[CSS grid](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Grid_Layout/Basic_Concepts_of_Grid_Layout).

These components provide props with predefined Hopper tokens for sizing, spacing,
and other layout options. You can use `Flex` and `Grid` together to build different
parts of your application, and even nest them to create more complex layouts.

You should prefer using flex and grid over other CSS layout models. Spacing between components should be managed by parent layout components rather than added directly to the children. This ensures components are composable when reused in different places and that spacing remains consistent.

In addition to `Flex` and `Grid`, some Hopper components include prebuilt layouts which you can
insert your content into via slots. You can read more about slots in the [slots](./slots) concept page.

## Flex

The [flexbox](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Flexible_Box_Layout/Basic_Concepts_of_Flexbox)
layout model is a simple yet versatile method of laying out components in rows and columns.
Use it to build vertical or horizontal stacks, simple wrapping grids, and more. The [Flex](./Flex)
component can be used to create flexbox containers. Any Hopper component can be used as a child within these containers.
Flex layouts can be nested to create more complex layouts.

The `gap`, `rowGap` and `columnGap` can be defined with [Hopper space tokens](/tokens/semantic/space)
to ensure consistency across applications, and allow the layout to adapt to different devices automatically.

### Example
A simple vertical stack, with a gap between each item defined using a [Hopper space token](/tokens/semantic/space).

## Grid

[CSS grid](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Grid_Layout/Basic_Concepts_of_Grid_Layout)
is a powerful way to lay out elements in two dimensions. It can be used to to build full page application
layouts, or smaller user interface elements. It is especially powerful because it allows you to build many types of
layouts without extra presentational elements, keeping your code clean and semantic. In addition, grid layouts
are automatically mirrored in right-to-left languages.

The [Grid](./Grid) component can be used as a container to define a grid layout. Any Hopper component can be used as
a child of a `Grid`. The `Grid` component extends the CSS syntax to support
defining grids using [Hopper-defined dimension tokens](/tokens/core/dimensions).
This ensures that sizing and spacing is consistent between applications, and allows the layout to adapt to different devices
automatically.

### Defining grids

There are many ways to define grids, but the simplest is to use the `areas` prop to declaratively
specify your layout using named areas. This prop accepts an array of strings which represent rows. Within the rows,
you specify space separated names for grid areas. The children of the `Grid` can declare the `gridArea` prop, which
places them into these named regions.

In addition, you can define the `columns` and `rows` props on the `Grid` container to specify the widths and heights of the columns and rows respectively. This can be
done using [Hopper-defined dimension tokens](/tokens/core/dimensions) to ensure they are adaptive on various devices.

The following example shows how you could use `Grid` to declare a common application layout, with a header, sidebar,
content area, and footer. Notice how there are no nested layout elements — the layout is entirely declared in the
`Grid` and the children simply declare where they should be placed.

## Responsive layout

All props of the Flex and Grid components support object syntax to specify different values for the prop depending on a responsive breakpoint.
You can learn more about responsive styles on the [Responsive Styles](/styled-system/concepts/responsive-styles) page.
