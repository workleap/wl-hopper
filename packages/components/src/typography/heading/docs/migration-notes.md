Coming from Orbiter, you should be aware of the following change:

- Headings no longer come with margin by default; you're now responsible for adding the appropriate margin yourself.

In order to migrate to Hopper Heading seamlessly here's a cheatsheet regarding the applied margin-bottom of each heading sizes: 

**xs** `calc(1.125rem * .5) | 9px`\
**sm** `calc(1.375rem * .5) | 11px`\
**md** `calc(1.75rem * .5) | 14px`\
**lg** `calc(2rem * .5) | 16px`\
**xl** `calc(2.5rem * .5) | 20px`\
**2xl** `calc(1rem * .5) | 8px`\
**3xl** `calc(1rem * .5) | 8px`

_Some UI might require different margins, this table is provided as a guidance to kickstart youre migration toward Hopper._
